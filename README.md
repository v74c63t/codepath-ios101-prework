# Prework - *SimpleColorApp*

Submitted by: **Vanessa Tang**

**SimpleColorApp** is an app that contains several options that can change the backgroup and text of the app. It contains a slider that can be toggled to bold or unbold the text and several buttons that have different functions. Users can input specific RGB values (0-255) into the text fields to change the background or text to a specific color. However, users can also opt to leave the text fields blank and use the buttons to change the background or text to a random color. In the case where not all text fields have values inputted, those that are empty will be defaulted to 0. If non numeric values are inputted, they will be converted to be 0 as well. The reset buttons is used to reset everything back to normal by essentially disgarding all the changes that were made.

Time spent: **6-7** hours spent in total

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

### Favorite Applications

- Messenger
  - Changing the background color of a chat and the color of messages
  - Adding emojis to certain keywords so if the word is sent emojis will pop up on the screen of the user
   
-  Youtube
   -  Being able to have certain videos playing in the background when the app is not open
   -  Uploading videos easily either publicly or privately for free

-  Instagram
   -  Sharing stories with only a certain group of people of your choosing
   -  Unsending/Deleting messages

### App Idea

- I don't particularly have a specific app idea in mind right now that I would like to build. One thing I would like to do is to build upon something I did last school year. I made a web app for one of my courses and one thing we had to build for it was a very simple Android app that communicates with the backend to do login and full text search using information from the database. I want to make an iOS app for it that has more functionalities from the webapp such as browsing by genre, implementing the shopping cart, etc.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

- It was difficult getting used to the UI for Xcode. It was easy to forget where each feature was located.
- Although it's not really a challenge encountered when building the app, I had many issues with getting the gif to upload and work with github, so I ultimately uploaded a mp4 and just included the original gif into the repo.
