# Prework - *Name of App Here*

Submitted by: **Vanessa Tang**

**Name of your app** is an app that contains several options that can change the backgroup and text of the app. It contains a slider that can be toggled to bold or unbold the text and several buttons that have different function. Users can input specific RGB values (0-255) into the text fields to change the background or text to a specific color. However, users can also opt to leave the text fields blank and use the buttons to change the background or text to a random color.
